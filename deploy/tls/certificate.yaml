  # Avoid using commonName for DNS names in end-entity (leaf) certificates. Unless you have a specific
  # need for it in your environment, use dnsNames exclusively to avoid issues with commonName.
  # Usually, commonName is used to give human-readable names to CA certificates and can be avoided for
  # other certificates.
  commonName: cloudobsm2.com

  # The literalSubject field is exclusive with subject and commonName. It allows
  # specifying the subject directly as a string. This is useful for when the order
  # of the subject fields is important or when the subject contains special types
  # which can be specified by their OID.
  #
  # literalSubject: "O=jetstack, CN=example.com, 2.5.4.42=John, 2.5.4.4=Doe"

  # At least one of commonName (possibly through literalSubject), dnsNames, uris, emailAddresses, ipAddresses or otherNames is required.
